# Tweets-Generator
Database analysis of data and creation of logical sentences using Markov chains.
Program over view:
tweetGenerator is a program that creat tweets from a reservoir of sentences.
The tweets (sentences) that the program creat actually are being built in a
random way but base on the appearance of each word close to other word in
the input file. At the end we will get legal sentence.
The program is expecting to get 4 arguments:
  1. Seed value (for randomness of the rand func) [can with time also]
  2. Number of tweets (sentences) we want out program ro creat.
  3. Path file (input file).
  4. Number of word we want our program to read from the input file (none can be enter and the program will read the whole file.

That's it! Hope you will have fun!

Enjoy!
